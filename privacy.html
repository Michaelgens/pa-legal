<h1>Privacy Policy — Personnal Assistant</h1>
<p>Last updated: 2025-09-15</p>

<h2>What we access</h2>
Personnal Assistant uses Google Sign-In to authenticate you and (only with your permission) reads events from your Google Calendar so the app can show and manage your schedule.</p>

<h2>Data we read</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Google profile info (name, email) — for account identification.</li>
  <li>Google Calendar events — to display and manage your schedule in the app.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where data is stored</h2>
<p>Access tokens are used only to call Google APIs. <strong>If</strong> we store refresh tokens or user data it is stored encrypted on our backend (or: tokens are stored only on your device). Replace this line with your actual storage behavior.</p>

<h2>How to remove access</h2>
<p>To stop access, go to your Google Account → Security → Third-party apps with account access, and remove MyApp; or sign out from within the app.</p>
